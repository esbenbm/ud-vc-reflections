When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When I might want to access my code on different computers or share my code with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	Because I need control of what "combined state" of files I am working on. Suppose pushes a changed file to GitHub which changes a function that I use in my code. Then my code would suddenly break :-(
