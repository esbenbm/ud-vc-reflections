When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When I might want to access my code on different computers or share my code with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	Because I need control of what "combined state" of files I am working on. Suppose pushes a changed file to GitHub which changes a function that I use in my code. Then my code would suddenly break :-(		

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	A branch is a copy of the code that I (and others) can work on without interfering with the main code. A branch can be merged with the main code if relevant but also deleted if it did not turn out all right.
	A clone is an exact copy of a repository without any link to the original repository.
	A fork is an exact copy on Github of a repository on GitHub. It holds a relation to the original repository on GitHub.
